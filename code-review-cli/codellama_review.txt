üîß Optimization:
The `is_prime` function can be optimized by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and space complexity of O(n). This would significantly reduce the runtime of the program for large inputs.

üö´ Bad Practices:
The `is_prime` function uses hardcoded values for the range of numbers to check, which makes it difficult to use the function for other purposes. A better approach would be to pass in the range as an argument to the function.

üîê Security:
The `get_primes` function does not sanitize the input list, which means that any user-supplied data could potentially cause a security vulnerability if it contains malicious inputs. The function should be modified to use a safer approach for handling user-supplied data.

üé® Style:
The `is_prime` function uses a mix of camelCase and snake_case conventions, which could be harmful in terms of readability. It is recommended to stick to one convention throughout the codebase.

‚ùó Logic Issues:
The `get_primes` function returns an empty list if no primes are found in the input list, but it should instead return a list containing all the numbers in the input list that are not prime. This would ensure that the output is always correct and consistent.

‚è±Ô∏è Complexity:
The time complexity of the `get_primes` function is O(n^2), which means that the runtime grows quadratically with the size of the input list. A more efficient approach could be to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and space complexity of O(n).

‚úÖ Final Suggestions:
The `is_prime` function can be optimized by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which would significantly reduce the runtime of the program for large inputs. The function should also be modified to use a safer approach for handling user-supplied data, and should be renamed to reflect its new purpose. The `get_primes` function should be renamed to reflect its new purpose and should return a list containing all the numbers in the input list that are not prime.
