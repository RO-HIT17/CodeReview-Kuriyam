Mrng a Meet
ANalysis of a Code review App then we were asked to look at models for a CLI

Jun-3
Setup a minimaslistic CLI for a code review app using python and the setup the ollama service
Testing the deepcoder , starcoder , and codellama models
Summarise the performance across various models
We were asked to test various methods to train/finetune models

Unsloth - used to finetune open source models

A method to fune tune
Take a Dataset
Use unsloth to finetune a open source ollama model
Use Lora to train only a part of those Parameters

There are a lot of trainers aavaliable like SFTT

FInetune steps
get a dataset
use colab and setup unsloth to train a open sourcemodel (codellama)
perform LoRA training using that PEFT
convert it to ollama useable model then use it

Todo in the Intern:
Get a Dataset
Chose a base model
Learn about training it
Finetune it using Lora
Make it ollama useable
