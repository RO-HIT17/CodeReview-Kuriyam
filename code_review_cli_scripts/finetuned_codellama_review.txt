- üîß Optimization: 

Your function could be written in a more concise and efficient way by using set comprehension. The following code snippet achieves the same result while reducing complexity.

```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    return len(set(arr)) != len(arr)
```

This implementation checks whether there are any duplicates present in an array, by simply creating a new set from that array's unique elements. If both sets have different lengths then there must be at least one duplicate element present. 

- üö´ Bad Practices: None found

- üîê Security: No obvious vulnerabilities identified.

- üé® Style:
The use of whitespace within the code can help improve readability, as it breaks up text blocks and helps delineate sections of logic or flow control constructs. In Python specifically, PEP8 (the official style guide for the language) recommends using 4 spaces for indenting rather than tabs to maintain uniformity across projects.

```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    # Four space indentation instead of tab.
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Space after colon.
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                return True

```

- ‚ùó Logic Issues: None found

- ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity: O(n^2) time complexity where n is the length of input array 'arr' since nested loops are being used.

To improve performance we can leverage a sorting technique which has average case complexity of O(n log n). We could also utilize a hash table to keep track of unique values in linear time with O(1) lookup for any given value, thus reducing overall complexity to O(n).

```python
def sorted_has_duplicates(arr):
    # Sort array
    arr.sort()
    
    # Iterate over pairs
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i] == arr[i+1]:
            return True
    
    # No duplicates found
    return False

```

- ‚úÖ Final Suggestions: 

Your input code could be improved by following these suggestions:

1. **Optimization**: The function `has_duplicates` could be optimized using set comprehension to reduce complexity and achieve the same result in fewer lines of code.

```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    return len(set(arr)) != len(arr)
```

2. **Security:** No obvious vulnerabilities identified. However, it's recommended to sanitize input parameters to prevent possible injection attacks or unintended data manipulation.

3. **PEP8 Compliance**: The use of 4 space indentation instead of tabs can improve readability and maintain uniformity across projects. 

```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                return True
```

4. **Logic Issues:** None found

5. **Complexity Analysis:** The function `has_duplicates` has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of input array 'arr', since nested loops are being used. This can be improved using sorting techniques or hash tables to reduce overall complexity to O(n log n). 

```python
def sorted_has_duplicates(arr):
    arr.sort()
    
    for i in range(len(arr)-1):
        if arr[i] == arr[i+1]:
            return True
        
    return False
```

6. **Final Suggestions:**

In summary, the suggested changes to your code include optimizing using set comprehension, improving performance by utilizing a sorting technique or hash table, following PEP8 style guidelines for indentation and syntax, ensuring proper sanitization of input parameters for security purposes, and implementing appropriate logic checks as necessary to ensure correct functionality.
